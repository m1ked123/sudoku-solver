#SudokuSolver 
A basic text-based Sudoku solving program that examines
a given Sudoku puzzle, solves, and prints said solution. A slight 
disadvantage to the version so far is that all of these puzzles must be
create in a text file in a very specific manner. Reading these files is
not very robust and makes a lot of assumptions about the file that is
being entered.

There is a graphical viewer for the SudokuSolver that
allows the user to see each step of the solving process, but overall
there is no version that allows the user to directly enter data on a
cell by cell basis which would be ideal.
